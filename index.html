      <div class="thought1">So, Mimzy you seem to have been angry recently, care to explain?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="rightthought">
      <div class="thought2">Meow... Yes I have endless complaints</div>
    </div>
    <div class="leftthought">
      <div class="thought3">Alright. Lets hear them then, maybe we can work something out.</div>
    </div>
    <<div class="rightthought">
      <div class="thought4">Why can't I eat the plants? You ever tried them? They're delicious!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="leftthought">
    <div class="thought5">They're poisonous...</div>
  </div>
  <div class="rightthought">
    <div class="thought6">I think you made that up. They never taste like poison, and honestly they taste better than whatever kibble you feed me!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="leftthought">
    <div class="thought7">Nope, they're poisonous, lets agree to disagree.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="rightthought">
    <div class="thought6">Okay well what about when you get mad when I hide, do you not understand the game of hide and seek?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="rightthought">
    <div class="thought6">Or what about when I get up at 3am and run around the house, you don't understand playtime clearly.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="leftthought">
    <div class="thought7">When you "hide" it's impossible to find you, I always think you ran away! And I will repeat this again... 3am is NOT playtime.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="rightthought">
    <div class="thought6">Okay, fine, no more 3am runs if you promise to play with me more during the day.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="leftthought">
    <div class="thought7">Okay, deal. Anymore complaints you have? I've got a couple of my own for you.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="rightthought">
    <div class="thought6">Let's hear them...</div>
  </div>
  <div class="leftthought">
    <div class="thought7">Your fur... its everywhere. My bed, my clothes, my computer, my food, my drinks. C'mon Mimz.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="rightthought">
    <div class="thought6">I CANT HELP THAT. I'll try to stop sitting on your pillows though.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="leftthought">
    <div class="thought7">Okay, okay. How about the endless amounts of cat litter in my apartment. Don't you remember you're not even supposed to be here?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="rightthought">
    <div class="thought6">Okay I apologize, I am a little reckless with that... I'm sorry im such a bad roommate :(</div>
  </div>
  <div class="leftthought">
    <div class="thought7">You might be a pain in the butt, but you're still a good roomate, I won't kick you out just yet...</div>
  </div>
  <div class="rightthought">
    <div class="thought6">Thanks, now what's for dinner?</div>
